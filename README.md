# Hi there, I'm Njagua 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate developer who loves coding, collaborating, and learning about new technology. Here's a bit about me and what I do:

## About Me

- 🔭 I’m currently working on https://njaguanyingi.netlify.app/
- 🌱 I’m currently learning TypeScript, IBM DevOps and Software Engineering Professional Certificate, and web3
- 👯 I want to collaborate on [Projects or Open Source Contributions]. Let's "commit" to some cool stuff together! 😉
- 🤔 Need help? I'm your "debugger"—ask me anything about Vanilla JavaScript, React JS, or even Figma.
- 💬 Hit me up if you want to chat about coding or just want to geek out about Toyota MR2s. They’re my “car-goals.”
- 📫 How to reach me: njagua.gma@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: They/Them (not a bug, it's a feature!).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love Toyota MR2s so much that if I could "clone" one, I'd put it in my "repo." 🚗💨

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

- [JAVASCRIPT DAILY LEARNING](https://github.com/njagua3/Daily-JS-EXPERIMENT) - A repo for daily Javascript learning. It’s like a "JS boot camp," but in your own time. ⏱️
- [SAFIRIKENYA](https://github.com/njagua3/safiri-2.0) -A tours & travel website that’s responsive on all devices. (Pack your bags; we're going on a coding journey! ✈️)
- [Ringbelt Property Management](https://ringbeltagents.netlify.app/) - A Landing Page for a Property Management Company. (Because even real estate needs some "clicks," too! 🏠)
- [VaGi Fashion]() - An e-commerce web app for a fashion designer in Kenya.
- [Moringa School Projects Tracker](https://moringaschool.netlify.app/) - A full-stack web app that keeps track of cohorts' projects. (No more “lost” projects—except in the cloud! ☁️).
